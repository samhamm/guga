  <h1>Sam's Guessing Game</h1>
  <h3>This game does a variety of things:</h3>
  <p>This script uses a JS 'prompt' to receive input from the user</p>
  <p>The user input is then stored into a variable called 'username'</p>
  <p>The 'username' variable is then concatenated with other text to make a greeting statement that is then presented to the user in an 'alert' box.

  <script src="app.js"></script>
